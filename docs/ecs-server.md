## Overview

AWS provides the ability for [ECS Tasks to assume an IAM role](
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html)
via an HTTP endpoint defined via the `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_FULL_URI` shell
ENV variable.

All AWS SDK clients using the the same ECS Server container credentials endpoint
URL will utilize the same AWS IAM Role.  Note that this feature is also compatible
with the [HTTP Client Provider](
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/credentials/endpointcreds).

## Starting the ECS Server

The server runs in the foreground to make it easy to start via systemd and Docker.

`aws-sso ecs run`

Will start the service on `localhost:4144`.   For security purposes, the `aws-sso`
ECS Server will _only_ run on localhost/127.0.0.1.  You may select an alternative
port via the `--port` flag or setting the `AWS_SSO_ECS_PORT` environment variable.

## Environment variables

### AWS\_CONTAINER\_CREDENTIALS\_FULL\_URI

AWS clients and `aws-sso` should use:

`AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_FULL_URI=http://localhost:4144/creds`

### AWS\_CONTAINER\_CREDENTIALS\_RELATIVE\_URI

It is important to _not_ set `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI`
as that takes precidence for `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_FULL_URI` and it is not
compatible with `aws-sso`.

## Selecting a role via ECS Server

Before you can assume a role, you must select an IAM role for the aws-sso ecs
server to present to clients.

`aws-sso ecs load`

Will start the interactive profile selector.  Or you may specify the `--profile`
flag or the `--account` and `--role` flags to specify the role on the command line.

**Note:** Subsequent calls to `aws-sso ecs load` will alter the current IAM Role
for all AWS Client SDKs using it.

## Assuming a role via ECS Server

Ensure you have exported the following shell ENV variable:

`export AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_FULL_URI=http://localhost:4144/creds`

Then just:

`aws sts get-caller-identity`

should show that you are using the IAM Role you loaded into the ecs server process.

## Determining the current role

Since only one role can be loaded at any given time in the default slot, there
may be times you would like to quickly determine the current role without
resorting to an IAM call:

`aws-sso ecs profile`

will return the currently loaded default profile.

## Unloading role credentials

If you would like to remove the default IAM Role credentials:

`aws-sso ecs unload`

## Storing multiple roles at a time

There may be cases where you would like to make multiple roles available at the 
same time without running multiple copies of the ECS server via `aws-sso ecs run`.
Each role is stored in a unique named slot based on the `ProfileName` which is
either set via [Profile](config.md#Profile) or the [ProfileFormat](
config.md#ProfileFormat) configuration options.

### Loading

Specify `aws-sso ecs load --slotted ...` and the individual role will be stored in
it's unique named slot based on it's profile name.

### Listing Profiles

To see a list of profiles loaded in named slots use `aws-sso ecs list`.

### Querying

Accessing the individual credentials is done via the `profile` query parameter:

`export AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_FULL_URI=http://localhost:4144/creds?profile=ExampleProfileName`

Would utilize the `ExampleProfileName` role.  Note that the `profile` parameter
value must be URL Escaped.

### Unloading

To remove a specific IAM Role credential from a named slot in the ECS Server,
you can use:

`aws-sso ecs unload --profile <profile>`

## Errors

The ECS Server API endpoint generates errors with the following JSON format:

```json
{
    code: "<error code>",
    message: "<message string>"
}
```

## Authentication

Support for the [AWS\_CONTAINER\_AUTHORIZATION\_TOKEN](
https://github.com/synfinatic/aws-sso-cli/issues/516) is TBD.  Please vote for
this feature if you want it!

## HTTPS Transport

Support for using [HTTPS](https://github.com/synfinatic/aws-sso-cli/issues/518)
is TBD.  Please vote for this feature if you want it!
